### Instructions

1. Edit this code so that it simulates 200 observations, with the self esteem variables all correlated at 0.4
```{r}
set.seed(1)
sim1 <- rnorm_multi(n=200,
              mu=0,
              sd=1,
              r=0.4,
              empirical=T,
              varnames=c('selfesteem1', 'selfesteem2', 'selfesteem3', 'selfesteem4'))
```

2. Edit this code so that it models a 1 factor latent variable 'selfesteem' comprising the 4 items of sim1
```{r}
model <- ' 
selfesteem =~ selfesteem1 + selfesteem2 + selfesteem3 + selfesteem4
'
mod <- cfa(model, sim1)
summary(mod)

```


Add a chunk here and put in some constructive feedback about the course
```{r}
#I honestly enjoyed the course a lot. I really hope for a stats course to be developed for year 4 for MSci Psych student
```
