### Instructions

1. Edit this code so that it simulates 200 observations, with the self esteem variables all correlated at 0.4
```{r}
sim1 <- rnorm_multi(n=200,
              mu=0,
              sd=1,
              r=0.4,
              empirical=T,
              varnames=c('selfesteem1', 'selfesteem2', 'selfesteem3', 'selfesteem4'))
```

2. Edit this code so that it models a 1 factor latent variable 'selfesteem' comprising the 4 items of sim1
```{r}
model <- ' 
selfesteem =~ selfesteem1 + selfesteem2 + selfesteem3 + selfesteem4
'
mod <- cfa(model, sim1)
summary(mod)
```


Add a chunk here and put in some constructive feedback about the course
```{r}
# I love this course. R is a practical and essential tool for a psychology student, and this course is well-structured with plenty of valuable materials.
# The practical session let me 'learning by doing' after the Monday lecture.
# Thank you to all the professors and staff who took part in this course!
